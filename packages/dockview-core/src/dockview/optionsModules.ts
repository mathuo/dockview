/**
 * Maps dockview options to the modules that implement them, so setting an
 * option for an absent module reports which module is missing instead of
 * silently doing nothing.
 *
 * This is the "declared intent" diagnostic. It fires when the user asks for a
 * feature via options — at construction and on every `updateOptions`. It
 * deliberately does *not* fire on user interaction: right-clicking without the
 * ContextMenu module stays silent (the browser's own menu shows), because the
 * `?.` service-slot call sites can't tell a missing module from a feature the
 * app never wanted.
 *
 * Rules are a flat list rather than a `Record<keyof DockviewOptions, ...>`
 * because dockview's options are nested and value-gated: `overflow.mode:
 * 'wrap'` needs MultiRowTabs while `overflow.search` needs AdvancedOverflow,
 * so one top-level key maps to several modules depending on its contents. A
 * rule per gated thing also lets `reason` name the exact path the user set,
 * which is the whole point of the message.
 *
 * ## Adding a rule
 *
 * A rule is just "this option needs that module". Whether that makes it paid is
 * not a judgement call: a module is enterprise iff it ships in
 * `dockview-enterprise`'s `Modules` list. {@link ENTERPRISE_MODULE_NAMES}
 * mirrors that list, and a test in dockview-enterprise fails if the two drift,
 * so naming the right module is the only thing you have to get right here.
 *
 * The one trap is picking the module. Don't infer it from what core does at
 * runtime: core may carry a fallback that hands a paid feature to free builds,
 * and reading that as "the option is free" turns one bug into two. Pick the
 * module that *implements the documented feature*; if core also does it, that's
 * a leak to fix in core, not a reason to drop the rule. `dockToEdgeGroups` is
 * the cautionary case — core's single-band fallback made it look free.
