# Dockview

## Introduction

Dockview is an abstraction built on top of [Gridviews](./gridview) where each view is a container of many tabbed panels.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="simple-dockview"
    react={SimpleDockview}
    typescript={attachSimpleDockview}
/>

<br />

> You can access the panels associated group through the `panel.group` variable.
> The group will always be defined and will change if a panel is moved into another group.

## DockviewReact Component

You can create a Dockview through the use of the `DockviewReact` component.

<p style={{ fontSize: '1.3em' }}>
    <span>{'All of these are React props available through the '}</span>
    <code>DockviewReact</code>
    <span>{' component.'}</span>
</p>
<DocRef declaration="IDockviewReactProps" />

## Dockview API

The Dockview API is exposed both at the `onReady` event and on each panel through `props.containerApi`.
Through this API you can control general features of the component and access all added panels.

```tsx title="Dockview API via Panel component"
const MyComponent = (props: IDockviewPanelProps<{ title: string }>) => {
    // props.containerApi...

    return <div>{`My first panel has the title: ${props.params.title}`}</div>;
};
```

```tsx title="Dockview API via the onReady callback"
const onReady = (event: DockviewReadyEvent) => {
    // event.api...
};
```

<p style={{ fontSize: '1.3em' }}>
    <span>{'All of these methods are available through the '}</span>
    <code>api</code>
    <span>{' property of '}</span>
    <code>DockviewComponent</code>
    <span>{' and the '}</span>
    <code>containerApi</code>
    <span>{' property of '}</span>
    <code>IDockviewPanel</code>
    <span>.</span>
</p>

<DocRef declaration="DockviewApi" />

## Dockview Panel API

```tsx
const MyComponent = (props: IDockviewPanelProps<{ title: string }>) => {
    // props.api...

    return <div>{`My first panel has the title: ${props.params.title}`}</div>;
};
```

<p style={{ fontSize: '1.3em' }}>
    <span>{'All of these are methods are available through the '}</span>
    <code>api</code>
    <span>{' property of '}</span>
    <code>IDockviewPanel</code>
    <span>.</span>
</p>

<DocRef declaration="DockviewPanelApi" />

## Theme

As well as importing the `dockview` stylesheet you must provide a class-based theme somewhere in your application. For example.

```tsx
// Providing a theme directly through the DockviewReact component props
<DockviewReact className="dockview-theme-dark" />

// Providing a theme somewhere in the DOM tree
<div className="dockview-theme-dark">
  <div>
    {/**...  */}
    <DockviewReact  />
  </div>
</div>
```

You can find more details on theming <Link to="../theme">here</Link>.

## Layout Persistance

Layouts are loaded and saved via to `fromJSON` and `toJSON` methods on the Dockview api.
The api also exposes an event `onDidLayoutChange` you can listen on to determine when the layout has changed.
Below are some snippets showing how you might load from and save to localStorage.

```tsx title="Saving the layout state to localStorage"
React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!api) {
        return;
    }

    const disposable = api.onDidLayoutChange(() => {
        const layout = api.toJSON();

        localStorage.setItem(
            'dockview_persistance_layout',
            JSON.stringify(layout)
        );
    });

    return () => {
        disposable.dispose();
    };
}, [api]);
```

```tsx title="Loading a layout from localStorage"
const onReady = (event: DockviewReadyEvent) => {
    const layoutString = localStorage.getItem('dockview_persistance_layout');

    let success = false;

    if (layoutString) {
        try {
            const layout = JSON.parse(layoutString);
            event.api.fromJSON(layout);
            success = true;
        } catch (err) {
            //
        }
    }

    if (!success) {
        // do something if there is no layout or there was a loading error
    }
};
```

Here is an example using the above code loading from and saving to localStorage.
If you refresh the page you should notice your layout is loaded as you left it.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="layout-dockview"
    react={DockviewPersistance}
/>

## Resizing

### Panel Resizing

Each Dockview contains of a number of groups and each group has a number of panels.
Logically a user may want to resize a panel, but this translates to resizing the group which contains that panel.

You can set the size of a panel using `props.api.setSize(...)`.
You can also set the size of the group associated with the panel using `props.api.group.api.setSize(...)` although this isn't recommended
due to the clunky syntax.

```tsx
// it's mandatory to provide either a height or a width, providing both is optional
props.api.setSize({
    height: 100,
    width: 200,
});

// you could also resize the panels group, although not recommended it achieved the same result
props.api.group.api.setSize({
    height: 100,
    width: 200,
});
```

You can see an example invoking both approaches below.

<MultiFrameworkContainer sandboxId="resize-dockview" react={ResizeDockview} />

### Container Resizing

The component will automatically resize to it's container.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="resizecontainer-dockview"
    react={DockviewResizeContainer}
/>

## Watermark

When the dockview is empty you may want to display some fallback content, this is refered to as the `watermark`.
By default there the watermark has no content but you can provide as a prop to `DockviewReact` a `watermarkComponent`
which will be rendered when there are no panels or groups.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="watermark-dockview"
    react={DockviewWatermark}
/>

## Drag And Drop

### Built-in behaviours

Dockview supports a wide variety of built-in Drag and Drop possibilities.
Below are some examples of the operations you can perform.

<img style={{ width: '60%' }} src={useBaseUrl('/img/add_to_tab.svg')} />

> Drag a tab onto another tab to place it inbetween existing tabs.

<img style={{ width: '60%' }} src={useBaseUrl('/img/add_to_empty_space.svg')} />

> Drag a tab to the right of the last tab to place it after the existing tabs.

<img style={{ width: '60%' }} src={useBaseUrl('/img/add_to_group.svg')} />

> Drag a group onto an existing group to merge the two groups.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-around' }}>
    <img style={{ width: '40%' }} src={useBaseUrl('/img/drop_positions.svg')} />
    <img
        style={{ width: '40%' }}
        src={useBaseUrl('/img/magnet_drop_positions.svg')}
    />
</div>

> Drag into the left/right/top/bottom target zone of a panel to create a new group in the selected direction.

> Drag into the center of a panel to add to that group.

> Drag to the edge of the dockview component to create a new group on the selected edge.

### Extended behaviours

For interaction with the Drag events directly the component exposes some method to help determine whether external drag events should be interacted with or not.

```tsx
/**
 * called when an ondrop event which does not originate from the dockview libray and
 * passes the showDndOverlay condition occurs
 **/
const onDidDrop = (event: DockviewDropEvent) => {
    const { group } = event;

    event.api.addPanel({
        id: 'test',
        component: 'default',
        position: {
            referencePanel: group.activePanel.id,
            direction: 'within',
        },
    });
};

/**
 * called for drag over events which do not originate from the dockview library
 * allowing the developer to decide where the overlay should be shown for a
 * particular drag event
 **/
const showDndOverlay = (event: DockviewDndOverlayEvent) => {
    return true;
};

return (
    <DockviewReact
        components={components}
        onReady={onReady}
        className="dockview-theme-abyss"
        onDidDrop={onDidDrop}
        showDndOverlay={showDndOverlay}
    />
);
```

### Intercepting Drag Events

You can intercept drag events to attach your own metadata using the `onWillDragPanel` and `onWillDragGroup` api methods.

<MultiFrameworkContainer sandboxId="dnd-dockview" react={DndDockview} />

### Third Party Dnd Libraries

This shows a simple example of a third-party library used inside a panel that relies on drag
and drop functionalities. This examples serves to show that `dockview` doesn't interfer with
any drag and drop logic for other controls.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="externaldnd-dockview"
    react={DockviewExternalDnd}
/>

## Floating Groups

Dockview has built-in support for floating groups. Each floating container can contain a single group with many panels
and you can have as many floating containers as needed. You cannot dock multiple groups together in the same floating container.

Floating groups can be interacted with whilst holding the `shift` key activating the `event.shiftKey` boolean property on `KeyboardEvent` events.

> Float an existing tab by holding `shift` whilst interacting with the tab

<img style={{ width: '60%' }} src={useBaseUrl('/img/float_add.svg')} />

> Move a floating tab by holding `shift` whilst moving the cursor or dragging the empty
> header space

<img style={{ width: '60%' }} src={useBaseUrl('/img/float_move.svg')} />

> Move an entire floating group by holding `shift` whilst dragging the empty header space

<img style={{ width: '60%' }} src={useBaseUrl('/img/float_group.svg')} />

Floating groups can be programatically added through the dockview `api` method `api.addFloatingGroup(...)` and you can check whether
a group is floating via the `group.api.isFloating` property. See examples for full code.

You can control the bounding box of floating groups through the optional `floatingGroupBounds` options:

-   `boundedWithinViewport` will force the entire floating group to be bounded within the docks viewport.
-   `{minimumHeightWithinViewport?: number, minimumWidthWithinViewport?: number}` sets the respective dimension minimums that must appears within the docks viewport
-   If no options are provided the defaults of `100px` minimum height and width within the viewport are set.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    height={600}
    sandboxId="floatinggroup-dockview"
    react={DockviewFloating}
/>

## Panels

### Add Panel

Using the dockview API you can access the `addPanel` method which returns an instance of the created panel.
The minimum method signature is:

```ts
const panel = api.addPanel({
    id: 'my_unique_panel_id',
    component: 'my_component',
});
```

where `id` is the unique id of the panel and `component` is the implenentation which
will be used to render the panel. You will have registered this using the `components` prop of the `DockviewReactComponent` component.

You can optionally provide a `tabComponent` parameters to the `addPanel` method which will render the tab using a custom renderer.
You will have registered this using the `tabComponents` prop of the `DockviewReactComponent` component.

```ts
const panel = api.addPanel({
    id: 'my_unique_panel_id',
    component: 'my_component',
    tabComponent: 'my_tab_component',
});
```

You can pass properties to the panel using the `params` key.
You can update these properties through the panels `api` object and its `updateParameters` method.

```ts
const panel = api.addPanel({
    id: 'my_unique_panel_id',
    component: 'my_component',
    params: {
        myCustomKey: 'my_custom_value',
    },
});

panel.api.updateParameters({
    myCustomKey: 'my_custom_value',
    myOtherCustomKey: 'my_other_custom_key',
});
```

> Note `updateParameters` does not accept partial parameter updates, you should call it with the entire set of parameters
> you want the panel to receive.

Finally `addPanel` accepts a `position` object which tells dockview where to place the panel.

-   This object optionally accepts either a `referencePanel` or `referenceGroup` which can be the associated id as a string
    or the panel/group object reference.
-   This object accepts a `direction` property which dictates where,
    relative to the provided reference the new panel will be placed.

> If neither a `referencePanel` or `referenceGroup` is provided then the `direction` will be treated as absolute.

> If no `direction` is provided the library will place the new panel in a pre-determined position.

```ts
const panel = api.addPanel({
    id: 'panel_1',
    component: 'default',
});

const panel2 = api.addPanel({
    id: 'panel_2',
    component: 'default',
    position: {
        referencePanel: panel1,
        direction: 'right',
    },
});
```

To add a floating panel you should include the `floating` variable which can be either a `boolean` or an object defining it's bounds.
These bounds are relative to the dockview component.

```ts
const panel1 = api.addPanel({
    id: 'panel_2',
    component: 'default',
    floating: true,
});

const panel2 = api.addPanel({
    id: 'panel_2',
    component: 'default',
    floating: { x: 10, y: 10, width: 300, height: 300 },
});
```

### Update Panel

You can programatically update the `params` passed through to the panel through the panal api using `api.updateParameters`.

```ts
const panel = api.addPanel({
    id: 'panel_1',
    component: 'default',
    params: {
        keyA: 'valueA',
    },
});

// ...

panel.api.updateParameters({
    keyB: 'valueB',
});

// ...

panel.api.updateParameters({
    keyA: 'anotherValueA',
});
```

To delete a parameter you should pass a value of `undefined` for the key.

```ts
panel.api.updateParameters({
    keyA: undefined, // this will delete 'keyA'.
});
```

### Move panel

You can programatically move a panel using the panel `api`.

```ts
panel.api.moveTo({ group, position, index });
```

An equivalent method for moving groups is avaliable on the group `api`.

```ts
const group = panel.api.group;
group.api.moveTo({ group, position });
```

### Remove panel

You can programatically remove a panel using the panel `api`.

```ts
panel.api.close();
```

Given a reference to the panel you can also use the component `api` to remove it.

```ts
const panel = api.getPanel('myPanel');
api.removePanel(panel);
```

### Panel Rendering

By default `DockviewReact` only adds to the DOM those panels that are visible,
if a panel is not the active tab and not shown the contents of the hidden panel will be removed from the DOM.

However the React Components associated with each panel are only created once and will always exist for as long as the panel exists, hidden or not.

> For example this means that any hooks in those components will run whether the panel is visible or not which may lead to excessive background work depending
> on the panels implementation.

This is the default behaviour to ensure the greatest flexibility for the user but through the panels `props.api` you can listen to the visiblity state of the panel
and write additional logic to optimize your application.

For example if you wanted to unmount the React Components when the panel is not visible you could create a Higher-Order-Component that listens to the panels
visiblity state and only renders the panel when visible.

```tsx title="Only rendering the React Component when the panel is visible, otherwise rendering a null React Component"
import { IDockviewPanelProps } from 'dockview';
import * as React from 'react';

function RenderWhenVisible(
    component: React.FunctionComponent<IDockviewPanelProps>
) {
    const HigherOrderComponent = (props: IDockviewPanelProps) => {
        const [visible, setVisible] = React.useState<boolean>(
            props.api.isVisible
        );

        React.useEffect(() => {
            const disposable = props.api.onDidVisibilityChange((event) =>
                setVisible(event.isVisible)
            );

            return () => {
                disposable.dispose();
            };
        }, [props.api]);

        if (!visible) {
            return null;
        }

        return React.createElement(component, props);
    };
    return HigherOrderComponent;
}
```

```tsx
const components = { default: RenderWhenVisible(MyComponent) };
```

Toggling the checkbox you can see that when you only render those panels which are visible the underling React component is destroyed when it becomes hidden and re-created when it becomes visible.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="rendering-dockview"
    react={RenderingDockview}
/>

## Headers

### Custom Tab Headers

You can provide custom renderers for your tab headers for maximum customization.
A default implementation of `DockviewDefaultTab` is provided should you only wish to attach minor
changes and events that do not alter the default behaviour, for example to add a custom context menu event
handler.

The `DockviewDefaulTab` component accepts a `hideClose` prop if you wish only to hide the close button.

```tsx title="Attaching a custom context menu event handlers to a custom header"
import { IDockviewPanelHeaderProps, DockviewDefaultTab } from 'dockview';

const MyCustomheader = (props: IDockviewPanelHeaderProps) => {
    const onContextMenu = (event: React.MouseEvent) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        alert('context menu');
    };
    return <DockviewDefaultTab onContextMenu={onContextMenu} {...props} />;
};
```

You are also free to define a custom renderer entirely from scratch and not make use of the `DockviewDefaultTab` component.
To use a custom renderer you can must register a collection of tab components.

```tsx
const tabComponents = {
    myCustomHeader: MyCustomHeader,
};

return <DockviewReact tabComponents={tabComponents}  ... />;
```

```tsx
api.addPanel({
    id: 'panel_1',
    component: 'default',
    tabComponent: 'myCustomHeader', // <-- your registered renderers
    title: 'Panel 1',
});
```

You can also override the default tab renderer which will be used when no `tabComponent` is provided to the `addPanel` function.

```tsx
<DockviewReact defaultTabComponent={MyCustomHeader}  ... />;
```

As a simple example the below attaches a custom event handler for the context menu on all tabs as a default tab renderer

The below example uses a custom tab renderer to reigster a popover when the user right clicked on a tab.
This still makes use of the `DockviewDefaultTab` since it's only a minor change.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="customheader-dockview"
    react={CustomHeadersDockview}
/>

### Default Tab Title

If you are using the default tab renderer you can set the title of a tab when creating it

```tsx
api.addPanel({
    id: 'panel_1',
    component: 'my_component',
    title: 'my_custom_title', // <-- special param for title
});
```

You can update the title through the panel api which can be accessed via `props.api` if you are inside the panel
component or via `api.getPanel('panel1').api` if you are accessing from outside of the panel component.

```tsx
api.setTitle('my_new_custom_title');
```

> Note this only works when using the default tab implementation.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="updatetitle-dockview"
    react={DockviewSetTitle}
/>

### Custom Tab Title

If you are using a custom tab implementation you should pass variables through as a parameter and render them
through your tab components implementation.

```tsx title="Add a panel with custom parameters"
api.addPanel({
    id: 'panel_2',
    component: 'my_component',
    tabComponent: 'my_tab',
    params: {
        myTitle: 'Window 2', // <-- passing a variable to use as a title
    },
});
```

```tsx title="Accessing custom parameters from a custom tab renderer"
const tabComponents = {
    default: (props: IDockviewPanelHeaderProps<{ myTitle: string }>) => {
        const title = props.params.myTitle; // <-- accessing my custom varaible
        return <div>{/** tab implementation as chosen by developer */}</div>;
    },
};
```

### Hidden Headers

You may wish to hide the header section of a group. This can achieved through the `hidden` variable on `panel.group.header`.

```tsx
panel.group.header.hidden = true;
```

### Full width tabs

`DockviewReactComponent` accepts the prop `singleTabMode`. If set `singleTabMode=fullwidth` then when there is only one tab in a group this tab will expand
to the entire width of the group. For example:

> This can be conmbined with <Link to="./dockview/#locked-group">Locked Groups</Link> to create an application that feels more like a Window Manager
> rather than a collection of groups and tabs.

```tsx
<DockviewReactComponent singleTabMode="fullwidth" {...otherProps} />
```

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="fullwidthtab-dockview"
    react={DockviewNative}
    typescript={attachNativeDockview}
/>

### Tab Height

Tab height can be controlled through CSS.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="tabheight-dockview"
    react={DockviewTabheight}
    typescript={attachTabHeightDockview}
/>

## Groups

### Locked group

Locking a group will disable all drop events for this group ensuring no additional panels can be added to the group through drop events.
You can still add groups to a locked panel programatically using the API though.

```tsx
panel.group.locked = true;

// Or

panel.group.locked = 'no-drop-target';
```

Use `true` to keep drop zones top, right, bottom, left for the group. Use `no-drop-target` to disable all drop zones. For you to get a
better understanding of what this means, try and drag the panels in the example below to the locked groups.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="lockedgroup-dockview"
    react={DockviewLockedGroup}
/>

### Group Controls Panel

`DockviewReact` accepts `leftHeaderActionsComponent`, `rightHeaderActionsComponent` and `prefixHeaderActionsComponent` which expect a React component with props `IDockviewHeaderActionsProps`.
These controls are rendered to left and right side of the space to the right of the tabs in the header bar as well as before the first tab in the case of the prefix header prop.

```tsx
const Component: React.FunctionComponent<IDockviewHeaderActionsProps> = () => {
    return <div>{'...'}</div>;
};

return <DockviewReact {...props} leftHeaderActionsComponent={Component} rightHeaderActionsComponent={...} />;
```

As a simple example the below uses the `groupControlComponent` to render a small control that indicates whether the group
is active and which panel is active in that group.

```tsx
const RightHeaderActionsComponent = (props: IDockviewHeaderActionsProps) => {
    const isGroupActive = props.isGroupActive;
    const activePanel = props.activePanel;

    return (
        <div className="dockview-groupcontrol-demo">
            <span
                className="dockview-groupcontrol-demo-group-active"
                style={{
                    background: isGroupActive ? 'green' : 'red',
                }}
            >
                {isGroupActive ? 'Group Active' : 'Group Inactive'}
            </span>
            <span className="dockview-groupcontrol-demo-active-panel">{`activePanel: ${
                activePanel?.id || 'null'
            }`}</span>
        </div>
    );
};
```

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="groupcontrol-dockview"
    react={DockviewGroupControl}
/>

### Constraints

You may wish to specify a minimum or maximum height or width for a group which can be done through the group api.

```tsx
api.group.api.setConstraints(...)
```

> Constraints are currently only supported for groups and not individual panels.
> If you specific a constraint on a group and move a panel within that group to another group it will no
> longer be subject to those constraints since those constraints were on the group and not on the individual panel.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    height={500}
    sandboxId="constraints-dockview"

## Render Mode

Dockview has two rendering modes `destructive` (default) and `gready`. A rendering mode can be defined through the `renderer` prop to `DockviewReact` or at an individual panel level when added where
the panel declaration takes precedence if both are defined. Rendering modes defined at the panel level are persisted, those defined at the `DockviewReact` level are not persisted.

destructive
- Destructive mode is the default mode. In this mode when a panel is no longer visible through either it's visiblity being hidden or it not being the active panel within a group the panels HTMLElement is removed
from the DOM and any DOM state such as scrollbar positions will be lost. If you are using any ResizeObservers to measure size this will result both zero height and width as the HTMLElement no longer belongs to the DOM.
This design allows for maximum performance at some cost.
- Gready mode. In this mode when panels become hidden the HTMLElement is not destroyed so all DOM state such as scrollbar positions will be maintained. This is implemented by rendering each panel as an absolutely positioned
HTMLElement and hidden the HTMLElement with `display: none` when it should be hidden.

## iFrames

iFrames required special attention because of a particular behaviour in how iFrames render:

> Re-parenting an iFrame will reload the contents of the iFrame or the rephrase this, moving an iFrame within the DOM will cause a reload of its contents.

You can find many examples of discussions on this. Two reputable forums for example are linked [here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=254144) and [here](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5484).

The problem with iFrames and `dockview` is that when you hide or move a panel that panels DOM element may be moved within the DOM or removed from the DOM completely.
If your panel contains an iFrame then that iFrame will reload after being re-positioned within the DOM tree and all state in that iFrame will most likely be lost.

`dockview` does not provide a built-in solution to this because it's too specific of a problem to include in the library.
However the below example does show an implementation of a higher-order component `HoistedDockviewPanel`that you could use to work around this problems and make iFrames behave in `dockview`.

What the higher-order component is doing is to hoist the panels contents into a DOM element that is always present and then `position: absolute` that element to match the dimensions of it's linked panel.
The visibility of these hoisted elements is then controlled through some exposed api methods to hide elements that shouldn't be currently shown.

You should open this example in CodeSandbox using the provided link to understand the code and make use of this implemention if required.

## Events

A simple example showing events fired by `dockviewz that can be interacted with.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    height={600}
    sandboxId="events-dockview"
    react={EventsDockview}
/>

## Keyboard Navigation

Keyboard shortcuts

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    height={600}
    sandboxId="keyboard-dockview"
    react={DockviewKeyboard}
/>

### Nested Dockviews

You can safely create multiple dockview instances within one page and nest dockviews within other dockviews.
If you wish to interact with the drop event from one dockview instance in another dockview instance you can implement the `showDndOverlay` and `onDidDrop` props on `DockviewReact`.

<MultiFrameworkContainer sandboxId="nested-dockview" react={NestedDockview} />

### Window-like mananger with tabs

<DockviewNative2 />

## RTL support

You can set the dockview to RTL using the `isRtl` property.

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="simple-dockview"
    react={SimpleDockview}
    isRtl={true}
/>

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="watermark-dockview"
    react={DockviewWatermark}
    isRtl={true}
/>

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    height={600}
    sandboxId="floatinggroup-dockview"
    react={DockviewFloating}
    isRtl={true}
/>

<MultiFrameworkContainer
    sandboxId="groupcontrol-dockview"
    react={DockviewGroupControl}
    isRtl={true}
/>

<DockviewNative2 isRtl={true} />
