# Project description

Pre-requisites: Node >=18, Yarn

Dockview is a layout manager library designed to provide a complete layouting solution.
It is written in plain TypeScript and can be used without any framework although
an extensive React wrapper has always and will always be provided for those using the React framework.

The project is hosted on GitHub and developed within a Monorepo powered by [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).
It is developed using the `yarn` package manager since at the time of creation `yarn` was far superior when it came to managing monorepos.
The Monorepo contains three packages:

#### packages/dockview-core

The core project is entirely written in plain TypeScript without any frameworks or dependencies and it's source-code can be found
within the `dockview-core` package which is also published to npm.

#### packages/dockview

A complete collection of React components for use through the React framework to use dockview seamlessly
and is published to npm. It depends explicitly on `dockview-core` so there is no need to additionally install `dockview-core`.

> Dockview was originally a React-only library which is why the React version maintains the name `dockview` after
> splitting the core logic into a seperate package named `dockview-core`.

#### packages/docs

This package contains the code for this documentation website and examples hosted through **CodeSandbox**. It is **not** a published package on npm.

# Run the project locally

1. After you have cloned the project from GitHub run `yarn` at the root of the project which will install all project dependencies.
2. In order build `packages/dockview-core` then `packages/dockview`.
3. Run the docs website through `npm run start` in the `packages/docs` directory and go to _http://localhost:3000_ which
   will now be running the local copy of `dockview` that you have just built.

### Examples

All examples can be found under [**packages/docs/sandboxes**](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/tree/master/packages/docs/sandboxes).
Each example is an independently runnable example through **CodeSandbox**.
Through the documentation you will see links to runnable **CodeSandbox** examples.

## FAQ

#### Are there any plans to publish wrapper libraries for other frameworks such as Angular and Vue?

Currently no but this is open for contributors to try.
