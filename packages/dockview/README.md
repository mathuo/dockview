## Quick start

Dockview has a peer dependency on `react >= 16.8.0` and `react-dom >= 16.8.0`. You can install dockview from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dockview).

```
npm install --save dockview
```

Within your project you must import or reference the stylesheet at `dockview/dist/styles/dockview.css` and attach a theme.

```css
@import '~dockview/dist/styles/dockview.css';
```

You should also attach a dockview theme to an element containing your components. For example:

```html
<body classname="dockview-theme-dark"></body>
```
