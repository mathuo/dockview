# Basics

This section will take you through a number of concepts that can be applied to all dockview components.

## Panels

The below examples use `ReactSplitview` but the logic holds for `ReactPaneview`, `ReactGridview` and `ReactDockview` using their respective implementations and interfaces.
All components require you to provide an `onReady` prop which you can use to build and control your component.

### Adding a panel with parameters

You can pass parameters to a panel through the `params` object

```tsx
const onReady = (event: SplitviewReadyEvent) => {
    event.api.addPanel({
        id: 'panel_1',
        component: 'myComponent',
        params: {
            title: 'My Title',
        },
    });
};
```

and you can access those properties through the `props.params` object. The TypeScript interface accepts an optional generic type `T` that corresponds to the params objects type.

```tsx
const MyComponent = (props: ISplitviewPanelProps<{ title: string }>) => {
    return <div>{`My first panel has the title: ${props.params.title}`}</div>;
};
```

## API

There are two types of API you will interact with using `dockview`.

-   The `panel API` is accessible via `props.api` in user defined panels and via the `.api` variable found on panel instances. This API contains actions and variable related to the the individual panel.
-   The `container API` is accessible via `event.api` in the `onReady` events and `props.containerApi` in user defined panels. This API contains actions and variable related to the component as a whole.

```tsx
const MyComponent = (props: ISplitviewPanelProps<{ title: string }>) => {
    React.useEffect(() => {
        const disposable = props.api.onDidActiveChange((event) => {
            console.log(`is panel active: ${event.isActive}`);
        });

        return () => {
            disposable.dispose(); // remember to dispose of any subscriptions
        };
    }, [props.api]);

    const addAnotherPanel = React.useCallback(() => {
        props.containerApi.addPanel({
            id: 'another_id',
            component: 'anotherComponent',
        });
    }, [props.containerApi]);

    return (
        <div>
            <span>{`My first panel has the title: ${props.params.title}`}</span>
            <button onClick={addAnotherPanel}>Add Panel</button>
        </div>
    );
};
```

### Serialization

All components support `toJSON(): T` which returns a Typed object representation of the components state. This same Typed object can be used to deserialize a view using `fromJSON(object: T): void`.

## Auto resizing

`SplitviewReact`, `GridviewReact`, `PaneviewReact` and `DockviewReact` will all automatically resize to fill the size of their parent element.
Internally this is achieved using a [ResizeObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver) which some users may need to polyfill.
You can disable this by settings the `disableAutoResizing` prop to be `true`.

You can manually resize a component using the API method `layout(width: number, height: number): void`.
An advanced case may use this in conjunction with `disableAutoResizing=true` to allow a parent component to have ultimate control over the dimensions of the component.

## Events

Many API properties can be listened on using the `Event` pattern. For example `api.onDidFocusChange(() => {...})`.
You should dispose of any event listeners you create cleaning up any listeners you would have created.

```tsx
React.useEffect(() => {
    const disposable = api.onDidFocusChange(() => {
        // write some code
    });

    return () => {
        disposable.dispose();
    };
}, []);
```

## Proportional layout

The `proportionalLayout` property indicates the expected behaviour of the component as it's container resizes, should all views resize equally or should just one view expand to fill the new space. `proportionalLayout` can be set as a property on `SplitviewReact` and `GridviewReact` components.
Although not configurable on `DockviewReact` and `PaneviewReact` these both behave as if `proportionalLayout=true` was set for them.

<SimpleSplitview2 proportional={false} />

<SimpleSplitview2 proportional={true} />

## Browser support

dockview is intended to support all major browsers. Some users may require a polyfill for [ResizeObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver).
